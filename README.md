# Translator
a basic attempt at using a neural net to translate words and phrases from English into French.

I have not studied French since middle school and cannot check the translations myself, I'll need to find someone to help me. 

The data in eng-fren.txt is from kaggle, original data can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/zeeshanshaik75/language-translationenglish-to-french I generated eng-fren.csv from it

This dataset has 154k rows of phrases and their translation.
